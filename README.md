# Rill Developer example project

This directory contains an example project for Rill Developer.

## Getting started

Run the following commands to clone the repository and start Rill:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rilldata/rill-developer-example.git
cd rill-developer-example
rill start
```

The initial call to `rill start` may take a while depending on your network connection as it downloads some large remote CSV files.
